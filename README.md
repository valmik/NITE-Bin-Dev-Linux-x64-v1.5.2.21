This was gotten from https://code.google.com/archive/p/simple-openni/downloads
from the file OpenNI_NITE_Installer_Linux64-0.27.zip.
I found this site via https://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/kinect/installation.html

This is just so that I can pull a git repo instead of downloading and unzipping a file.
